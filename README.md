### Overview
The objective of this solo project is to use react, redux, and routing to build an application that fetchs data.  A user is able to view weapons and armor selecting pieces that he/she is interested in, or creating a build that they want to keep track of.  By clicking on a card it will be moved into the build stats area on the left side of the page, once they have all the pieces of equipment they want the save set button will save the set to be viewed if the user clicks on equipment box in the top right.
